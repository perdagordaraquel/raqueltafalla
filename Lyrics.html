        I'm trying to hold my breath
        Let it stay this way
        Can't let this moment end
        You set off a dream in me
        Getting louder now
        Can you hear it echoing?
        Take my hand
        Will you share this with me?
        'Cause darling, without you
        All the shine of a thousand spotlights
        All the stars we steal from the night sky
        Will never be enough
        Never be enough
        Towers of gold are still too little
        These hands could hold the world but it'll
        Never be enough
        Never be enough
        For me
        Never, never
        Never, never
        Never, for me
        For me
        Never enough
        Never enough
        Never enough
        For me
        For me
        For me
        All the shine of a thousand spotlights
        All the stars we steal from the night sky
        Will never be enough
        Never be enough
        Towers of gold are still too little
        These hands could hold the world but it'll
        Never be enough
        Never be enough
        For me
        Never, never
        Never, never
        Never, for me
        For me
        Never enough
        Never, never
        Never enough
        Never, never
        Never enough
        For me
        For me
        For me
        For me
