    <p>
        Sweet pepper,(Capsicum annun)of the Solanaceae, or nigthshade family, is grown throughout the world,
        and species not only includes the green bell-shaped, sweet peppers that are common garden varieties but also hot peppers 
        used for spices such as chili. Most cultivated peppers belong to one and two major groups. The blossom
        yields the globose, mild - flavored, sweet peppers and the Spanish pepper.
        Vegetable production ranks even higher than all root crops and grain legumes (Knott, 1967). Sweet pepper is a 
        tropical and subtropical plant with a minimum temperature of 21°C with humidity of 70 to 75 percent however, a temparature 
        of 30°C may reduce fruit set and cause buds and flowers to drop. The crop is rich in vitamins A and C, niacin, riboflavin and 
        thiamine. Moderately deep, fertile, well-drained soil with medium nitrogen is a requirement for a succesful sweet
        pepper production (Bricked, 1992).
        Sweet pepper along with others Solanaceous crop such as eggplant, tomato and potato are cslled "warm season crops" because 
        they can be grown under relatively warm climate. Pepper is apparently more drougth resistance than either tomato or eggplant.
        Nevertheless, best yield and a mean temparature at blossom setting time ranging from 18.48°C (Attfield, 1993).
        In sweet pepper, several investagations have already been undertake to determine the growth and yield response to fertilizer
        (Mercado, 1954; PCARRD, 1976; Knott and Deanon, 1970) but no studies had been made on the effect on the organic and inorganic
        fertilizer under Calbayog condition hence, this study.

        <h4>Objective of the study</h4>
        This study aimed to:
        <p>1. Evaluate the growth and yield performance of the sweet pepper as influenced 
        by organic and inorganic fertilizer application under Calbayog condition.
        <p>2 Determine which of the treatments would gave the highest fruit yield under
            Calbayog condition.
        <p> 3. Analyze the cost and return of growing sweet pepper under Calbayog condition.</p>

        <h4>Time and Place of the Study</h4>
        This study was conducted from September 30, 2005 up to February 14, 2006 at Brgy. Carayman
        Calbayog, City.

        <h4>Scope and Limitation</h4> 
         This study was limited to the growth and yield performance of sweet pepper as influenced 
         by inorganic using complete plus ammophos fertilizer and organic fertilizer applications using
         chicken dung and carabao manure under Brgy. Carayman, Calbayog condition.

        <h2>Exercises Reflection</h2>
        <p>Creating this HTML code helped me see the importance of keeping my work clean and correct. I learned that proper indentation, complete closing tags, and correct placement of elements make the code easier to read and understand. When I fixed the errors, 
           I realized how one missing tag can affect the entire webpage. This taught me to be more careful and patient when coding.
           Even though I made mistakes, I believe they helped me grow and understand HTML better. This activity showed me that writing clean code is not just about following rules it’s also about building good habits that will help me in future projects.
